## Usage

Lanyon is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.

## Options

Lanyon includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.

### Themes

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/blob/master/public/css/lanyon.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

## Development

Lanyon has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

-   `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be to submitted against `master`.**
-   `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**
